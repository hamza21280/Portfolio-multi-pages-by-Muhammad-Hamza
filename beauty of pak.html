    <h1>Attabad Lake:</h1>
    <b>A lake that doesn’t look real… Even when you’re standing right in front of it. Attabad was
         born out of tragedy when a massive landslide occurred in 2010. The flow of the Hunza River
          was blocked, and the now-famous lake was created in its wake. Its bright-blue turquoise waters 
          make the it one of the most beautiful places in Pakistan.The genesis of the lake lies in a landslide
           in the Attabad village within the Hunza Valley, in Gilgit-Baltistan. On 4 January 2010, a 
           substantial landslide, occurring approximately 14 kilometers (9 miles) upstream to the east of
            Karimabad, led to the creation of this body of water. The landslide claimed the lives of twenty individuals 
            and triggered the obstruction of the Hunza River's flow for a period of five months. It also resulted in the 
            displacement of around 6,000 residents from villages located upstream, while an additional 25,000 individuals
             found themselves stranded due to the disruption of land transportation routes.[4] Furthermore, the lake inundated
              a considerable stretch measuring over 19 kilometers (12 miles) of the Karakoram Highway, a pivotal transportation
               artery in the region.[5] The lake reached 21 kilometres (13 mi) long and over 100 metres (330 ft) in depth
                by the first week of June, 2010, when it began flowing over the landslide dam, completely submerging lower 
                Shishkat and partly flooding Gulmit.[6] The subdivision of Gojal has the greatest number of flooded buildings,
                 over 170 houses, and 120 shops. The residents also had shortages of food and other items due to the blockage of the Karakoram Highway.[7]
          By 4 June 2010, water outflow from the lake had increased to 100 m3/s (3,700 cu ft/s).[8] The escalation of water levels persisted until June 18, 2010,
           driven by a disparity between the outflow and inflow dynamics of the newly formed lake. As bad weather continued, the supply of food, medicine and other goods was
            stopped as all forms of transportation including helicopter service to Hunza could not resume.[9]</b>

            <h1>Hunza:</h1>
            <b>Buddhism and, to a lesser extent, Bön were the primary religions in the area.[4] The region holds several surviving Buddhist archaeological sites, such as the Sacred Rock
                 of Hunza. Hunza Valley was central in the network of trading routes connecting Central Asia to the subcontinent. It also provided protection to Buddhist missionaries and monk
                 s visiting the subcontinent, and the region played a significant role in the transmission of Buddhism throughout Asia.[5]

                Before the arrival of Islam, the majority of the region practiced Buddhism. Since then, most of the population has converted to Islam, predominantly following the Ismaili sect.
                 The region has many works of graffiti in the ancient Brahmi script written on rocks, produced by Buddhist monks as a form of worship and culture.[6] With most locals converting to Islam,
                  they had been mainly left ignored, destroyed, or forgotten, but are now being restored.[7]
                
                "Hunza was formerly a princely state bordering Xinjiang (autonomous region of China) to the northeast and Pamir to the northwest, which survived until 1974, when it was finally dissolved by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
                 The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south and the former princely state of Nagar to the east. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as Karimabad); another old settlement is Ganish Village which means 'Baba Ganesh village'
                 (a Hindu name, Ganesh being name of a hindu deity).[8] Hunza was an independent principality for more than 900 years and then in the early 1800s, Hunza played a vital role in the British "Great Game". In 1891 Hunza was captured by the British 
                 Empire, and the ruler of Hunza, Mir Safdar Ali Khan, fled to Kashgar, China, and the British army installed his brother Mir Nazim Khan (1892-1938) as a puppet ruler of Hunza Valley, but all orders were passed by British officers who were appointed in the capital Gilgit."[9]</b>
