            <h1>History:</h1>
           Before writing essay on Pakistan, lets disucss its history first. Muslims of the subcontinent were not given the proper rights and were harassed for
            living according to the Islamic way. Pakistan was a dream for Allama Muhammad Iqbal that came true after many sacrifices and struggles of many Muslims.
           The major effort and struggle was of Quid e Azam M.A. Jinnah. This effort to get a separate country started when Muslims started facing persecution. The
            idea of two nation theory was presented that Muslims and Hindus are different nations that can’t live together peacefully.
           Quaid e Azam succeeded on 14 Aug 1947 when a new country known as Pakistan was formed. Initially, Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan, but due to the 1971 
           civil war and political problems, East Pakistan (Bangladesh) proclaimed its independence.
           When Pakistan got its independence, it faced several problems, such as unfair boundary distribution, economic problems, the Kashmir dispute, electricity
            problems, division of financial assets, etc. Karachi was chosen as the capital of Pakistan Quaid e Azam was the first governor-general, and Liaquat Ali Khan was the prime minister.
